**Web Random Shot | Discover Random Amazing Websites**

webRshot is a playful web app that lets you discover a random amazing website or creative project with a single click.  
Click the **Random Shot!** button and instantly open a new, handpicked site from a curated list of fun, inspiring, and useful web experiences.

## Features

- **One-click discovery:** Press the button and a random website opens in a new tab.
- **Curated list:** All sites are handpicked for creativity, usefulness, or just plain fun.
- **No repeats (until refresh):** The app keeps track of which sites you’ve visited in your browser, so you don’t get the same site twice until you’ve seen them all.
- **Social sharing:** Share webRshot with friends on Twitter/X or Facebook.

## How it works

- The app uses a JavaScript array of URLs.
- When you click "Random Shot!", it randomly selects a site you haven’t visited yet and opens it in a new tab.
- Once all sites have been visited, the list resets.
- Your progress is stored in your browser’s localStorage.
